# Plugins
Plugins are scripts which allow you to add custom functionality to Deezer.

### DevMode
Enables DevMode which enabled DevTool (ctrl+shift+i).

### URL Bar
Adds a URL Bar which allows you to view and edit the current path of the url. Supports ajax loading.

### Disable Sentry
Disables the sending of telementry to Sentry.io.

### Release Radar
Adds a functional Release Radar to Deezer. This is a port of [this](https://github.com/bertigert/Deezer-Release-Radar) userscript.

### Artist Dumper
Allows you to add all songs by an artist to a playlist or an already existing one. Highly configurable. Port of [this](https://github.com/bertigert/Deezer-Release-Radar) userscript.

### Display All Songs
A script allowing you to view all releases by an artist, not just the ones deezer thinks are important. Port of [this](https://github.com/bertigert/deezer-list-all-releases/) userscript.

### Exponential Volume
Changes the volume control to increase exponentially, allowing for more precise lower values. Probably very easy to adapt to increase the maximum volume. Port of [this](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/487324-youtube-volume-fixer) userscript. Note: Not tested by me.

### Toggle Features
A plugin to toggle various features in the desktop application, for example gapless playback. Very experimental plugin, I've tested basically 0 features, so only change features if you are sure what you are doing. By default gapless playback is enabled.

### Discord RPC
Automatically displays your currently playing song on Discord. Inspired by https://github.com/JustYuuto/deezer-discord-rpc, has the same features.
