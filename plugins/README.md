# Plugins
Plugins are scripts which allow you to add custom functionality to Deezer. To install them, download the js file and put them into your plugins folder in `%localappdata%\Local\Programs\deezer-desktop\plugins` (or wherever your deezer installation is located) or follow the plugins instructions, if there are any.


## Featured Plugins (Sorted A-Z)

### Artist Dumper
Allows you to add all songs by an artist to a playlist or an already existing one. Highly configurable. Port of [this](https://github.com/bertigert/Deezer-Release-Radar) userscript.

### Autofocus Main Window
Automatically focuses the main window whenever you enter the application. This allows you to, for example, always use the hotkeys when tabbing into the application, removing the need to click into it.

### Blacklist Song
Allows you to blacklist songs/artists from playing. Port of [this](https://github.com/bertigert/Deezer-Blacklist-Songs) userscript.

### Disable Sentry
Disables the sending of telementry to Sentry.io.

### Discord RPC
Automatically displays your currently playing song on Discord. Inspired by https://github.com/JustYuuto/deezer-discord-rpc, has the same features.

### Display All Songs
A script allowing you to view all releases by an artist, not just the ones deezer thinks are important. Port of [this](https://github.com/bertigert/deezer-list-all-releases/) userscript.

### Enable Dev Mode
Enables DevMode which enables DevTool (ctrl+shift+i).

### Exponential Volume
Changes the volume control to increase exponentially, allowing for more precise lower values. Probably very easy to adapt to increase the maximum volume. Port of [this](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/487324-youtube-volume-fixer) userscript. Note: Not tested by me.

### Lyrics Sync
A script for integrating Musixmatch and custom lyrics into Deezer. Port of [this](https://github.com/bertigert/Deezer-Lyrics-Sync) userscript.

### Toggle Features
A plugin to toggle various features in the desktop application, for example gapless playback. Very experimental plugin, I've tested basically 0 features, so only change features if you are sure what you are doing. By default gapless playback is enabled.
