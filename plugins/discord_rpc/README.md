## More information

This plugin requires a few dependencies. They are all inside of the discord_rpc folder. Based on https://github.com/xhayper/discord-rpc and inspired by https://github.com/JustYuuto/deezer-discord-rpc.

To install the plugin you must download the [main plugin file](https://github.com/bababoi-2/DeezMod/blob/main/plugins/discord_rpc/discord_rpc.js). You must then install the [bundled version](https://github.com/bababoi-2/DeezMod/blob/main/plugins/discord_rpc/discord_rpc/bundled_deps.js) of the dependencies and put it in plugins/discord_rpc/bundled_deps.js.

Alternatively you can download both [discord-rpc](https://github.com/bababoi-2/DeezMod/tree/main/plugins/discord_rpc/discord_rpc/discord-rpc) and [node_modules](https://github.com/bababoi-2/DeezMod/tree/main/plugins/discord_rpc/discord_rpc/node_modules) and put them in plugins/discord_rpc.
